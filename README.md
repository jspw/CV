### Detail

```
The "web" has taken the world by a storm. It started more than two decades ago. Most applications have a web based front-end.
HTML and CSS are the bread and butter of web applications.

Your first project is to write your CV in HTML. The CV has to have to following items:
    1.Your profile picture
    2.Your contact information
    3.A section with your academic history (school, college, university)
    4.A section list all the projects you have done. Each project should have a title and a description.

Make the CV look as polished as you can in the given timeframe. Use a global CSS file. Avoid inline styles as much as possible.

Do not use tables in the HTML.
